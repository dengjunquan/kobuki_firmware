Kobuki Firmware
===============

*This package is not a necessary dependency for the Kobuki runtime.* It simply packages the firmware binaries,
which should only ever be needed if you need to re-flash or upgrade your Kobuki's firwmare.

## Identify a Version

Versioned binaries can be found in [firmware](/firmware) folder, some of which are uniquely qualified with
a descriptive suffix to help you find the version you need.

* latest: most recent, but be aware that this version hasn't been tested much
* stable: more recent than factory and reasonably well tested
* factory: flashed onto the robots at the factory, has undergone stress testing

Refer to the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.rst) for more specific details.
